    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
      I am a PIP2 Manager qualified Detective Inspector specialising in digital
      investigations with a demonstrated history of working in criminal
      investigations and offender management within law enforcement.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am a clear and engaging communicator with good presentation skills,
      including having to frequently visualise and explain complex data in
      simplistic terms. I present to a range of audiences including students,
      experienced police officers, professional colleagues and senior
      stakeholders.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have completed a Master's degree focusing on policing's adaptation and
      adoption of digital investigative tactics in criminal investigation. This
      was completed to distinction level and has been published and presented at
      an international academic conference. I have lectured at MSc level to
      students on a Cyber Security MSc course. I am currently studying on an MSc
      Computing Science course.
    </p>

    <p>
      I hold a number of ICT, ICT Network, Cyber Security and Cyber Security
      Analysis qualifications alongside the Home Office Communications Data
      Investigator accreditation and associated communications data analysis and
      open source accreditations.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was responsible for establishing and leading
      <a href="https://www.norfolk.police.uk/"> Norfolk Constabulary's</a>
      Digital Investigation Team. I am currently the Technical Lead on the
      national <a href="https://www.toexprogramme.co.uk/">TOEX</a> team.
